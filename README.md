# Face Mask Detection in CCTV Surveillance



## Features

- **Automatic detection of face masks** in CCTV surveillance footage.
- **Integration with existing CCTV surveillance systems** for real-time monitoring of mask compliance.
- **Utilization of transfer learning** to adapt pre-trained object detection models to the specific context of surveillance footage.
- **Customizable threshold settings** for mask detection to accommodate varying lighting conditions and camera angles.
- **Logging and reporting** of mask compliance violations for further analysis and action.

## Usage

- Monitoring mask compliance in public areas such as airports, train stations, shopping malls, and educational institutions.
- Enforcing safety guidelines and regulations related to mask-wearing during public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Providing real-time alerts and notifications to security personnel or authorities when individuals are detected without masks.

## How to Use

1. **Install and configure**: Install and configure the face mask detection module on CCTV surveillance systems.
2. **Settings configuration**: Configure the module's settings, including camera feeds, detection thresholds, and alerting mechanisms.
3. **Real-time monitoring**: Monitor the system dashboard or receive alerts in real-time to identify instances of mask non-compliance.
4. **Data analysis**: Review logged data and reports to analyze trends in mask-wearing behavior and identify areas for improvement.
